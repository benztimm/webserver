## Results and Conclusions

### What I Learned
#### Ekarat buddharuksa
From this project, I learned about the construction of web servers. Frequently using frameworks like Flask, I hadn't fully appreciated the complexity behind them. Building a server from scratch showed me the intense attention and logic required, for which I am thankful for the experience.

The project also improved my problem-solving skills, as I navigated through challenges and bugs. I also gained insight into the basics of handling requests and responses. It was an eye-opener on which make me realize how important of the webserver really are.

In conclusion, this project has been a learning journey. It not only deepened my technical skills and understanding of web server development but also allow me to appreciate for the underlying technology that powers the web applications we often take for granted. I am eager to apply these insights in future projects and continue exploring the vast landscape of web development.


### Challenges I Encountered
#### Ekarat buddharuksa
In the process of completing this assignment, I encountered several challenges, primarily related to understanding the project's template. Initially, I was unsure of the role and purpose of each class within the template. This uncertainty made it difficult to see how the components fit together to create a functional web server. However, through active discussions with classmates on Discord and by closely examining how the test modules were structured, I gradually gained a clearer understanding of how each class was intended to function and contribute to the overall project.

Another challenge was the realization that the project template provided to us was not entirely complete or functional from the outset. It appeared that numerous adjustments were necessary to align the template with the test modules effectively. This led to a significant amount of trial and error as I worked to identify and implement the changes needed to make everything work as intended.

To overcome these challenges, I was make a discussions on Discord. This was really helpful, providing insights and different perspectives that I hadn't considered. Additionally, I try to look into the test module. This gave me a glimpse of how each class should be implement and how is it work, provided me a clear idea how to implement each class and method. This hands-on problem-solving and adaptation process not only helped me complete the assignment but also improve my learning experience, teaching me the importance of flexibility and perseverance in the face of technical challenges.

### System Design (Extra Credit - 5 pts)

We decided not to pursue this System Design Extra Credit.
